 * What is the objective with the command class? I want it to:
 * - Be easily extendable by me (adding a new class, for example)
 *   How? Hierarchy
 *
 * - Follow a hierarchy (so I can call the same methods for all commands)
 *   How? Hierarchy
 *
 * - Let a user change the command name
 *   How? Storing command name in persistence
 *
 * - Let a user change the command permissions
 *   How? Storing permissions in persistence
 *
 * What is NOT the objective?
 * - Have users add new commands through the bot
 * - Have users change the command parameters
 * - Have users change the command functionality
